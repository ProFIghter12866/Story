<u><h3><strong>Chapter One
Bruno Makes a Discovery</h3></u></strong>
<h3> One afternoon, when Bruno came home from school, he
was surprised to find Maria, the family's maid - who always kept
her head bowed and never looked up from the carpet - standing in
his bedroom, pulling all his belongings out of the wardrobe and
packing them in four large wooden crates, even the things he'd
hidden at the back that belonged to him and were nobody else's
business.</h3>
<h3>'What are you doing?' he asked in as polite a tone as he could
muster, for although he wasn't happy to come home and find
someone going through his possessions, his mother had always
told him that he was to treat Maria respectfully and not just
imitate the way Father spoke to her. 'You take your hands off my
things.'</h3>
<h3>Maria shook her head and pointed towards the staircase behind
him, where Bruno's mother had just appeared. She was a tall
woman with long red hair that she bundled into a sort of net
behind her head, and she was twisting her hands (page 2)
together nervously as if there was something she didn't want to
have to say or something she didn't want to have to believe.</h3>
<h3>'Mother,' said Bruno, marching towards her, 'what's going on? Why
is Maria going through my things?'
'She's packing them,' explained Mother</h3>
<h3>'Packing them?' he asked, running quickly through the events of
the previous few days to consider whether he'd been particularly
naughty or had used those words out loud that he wasn't allowed
to use and was being sent away because of it. He couldn't think of
anything though. In fact over the last few days he had behaved in
a perfectly decent manner to everyone and couldn't remember
causing any chaos at all. 'Why?' he asked then. 'What have I
done?</h3>
<h3>Mother had walked into her own bedroom by then but Lars, the
butler, was in there, packing her things too. She sighed and threw
her hands in the air in frustration before marching back to the
staircase, followed by Bruno, who wasn't going to let the matter
drop without an explanation.</h3>
<h3>'Mother,' he insisted. 'What's going on? Are we moving?'</h3>
<h3>'Come downstairs with me,' said Mother, leading the way towards
the large dining room where the Fury had been to dinner the week
before. 'We'll talk down there.</h3>
<h3> Bruno ran downstairs and even passed her out on the
staircase so that he was waiting in the dining room when she
arrived. He looked at her without saying anything for a moment
and thought to himself that she couldn't have applied her make-up
correctly that morning because the rims of her eyes were more red
than usual, like his own after he'd been causing chaos and got into
trouble and ended up crying.</h3>
<h3>Now, you don't have to worry, Bruno,' said Mother, sitting down in
the chair where the beautiful blonde woman who had come to
dinner with the Fury had sat and waved at him when Father closed
the doors. 'In fact if anything it's going to be a great adventure.'</h3>
<h3>'What is?' he asked. 'Am I being sent away?</h3>
<h3>'No, not just you,' she said, looking as if she might smile for a
moment but thinking better of it. 'We all are. Your father and I,
Gretel and you. All four of us.'</h3>
<h3>Bruno thought about this and frowned. He wasn't particularly
bothered if Gretel was being sent away because she was a
Hopeless Case and caused nothing but trouble for him. But it
seemed a little unfair that they all had to go with her.</h3>
<h3>'But where?' he asked. 'Where are we going exactly? Why can't we
stay here?'</h3>
<h3>'Your father's job,' explained Mother. 'You know how important it
is, don't you?'</h3>
<h3>'Yes, of course,' said Bruno, nodding his head, because
there were always so many visitors to the house - men in fantastic
uniforms, women with typewriters that he had to keep his mucky
hands off - and they were always very polite to Father and told
each other that he was a man to watch and that the Fury had big
things in mind for him. 'Well, sometimes when someone is very important,' continued
Mother, 'The man who employs him asks him to go somewhere
else because there's a very special job that needs doing there.
